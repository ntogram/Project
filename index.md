  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <h3>Kubernates</h3>
 <p>Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.</p>
 <h3> Microk8s</h3>
 <p>
  MicroK8s is a CNCF certified upstream Kubernetes deployment that runs entirely in your workstation. Being a snap it runs all Kubernetes services natively (i.e. no virtual machines) while packing the entire set of libraries and binaries needed. Installation is limited by how fast you can download a couple of hundred megabytes and the removal of MicroK8s leaves nothing behind
